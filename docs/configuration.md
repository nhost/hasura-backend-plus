## Registration

### Activate accounts

By default, accounts are automatically activated on registration. You may want to change this so you add a step to the registration process.

To deactivate autoactivation, set the environment variable `AUTO_ACTIVATE_NEW_USERS=false`

In addition to this, you can send a verification email with an activation link. You will then need to [configure the connection to a SMTP server](#enable-emails).

If SMTP is enabled, then the user will receive an email with an activation link. If the activation succeeds, the user is redirected to the url found in the `REDIRECT_URL_SUCCESS` environment variable. If it fails, they will redirected to the url given by the `REDIRECT_URL_ERROR` environment variable.

You can change the default email templates. In order to do so, you can mount [custom configuration files](#custom-configuration-files) when using docker, or change files in the [custom directory](https://github.com/nhost/hasura-backend-plus/tree/master/custom) when running HBP from the source code.
Other email templates are available and described [here](#email-templates)

### Limit email domains

You can limit registration to ranges of emails that are only part of a whitelist. For instance, you may want to limit registration only to the email addresses of your own organisation. You can pass a list of comma-separated email domains to the `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS` environment variable, for instance:

```
ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS=gmail.com,yourorganisation.com
```

### Password constraints

By default, clients can register with a password of at least three characters. You can change this in setting a higher value:

```
MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH=6
```

You can ask HBP to check on [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords) if the password has been previously exposed in data breaches. If so, the registration will fail. This option is disabled by default. You can change it to:

```
HIBP_ENABLE=true
```

### Additional registration fields

You may want to extend the `public.users` table with your own fields and relations, and to expect the client to set some of them when registering. It is possible to set a list of columns in the `REGISTRATION_CUSTOM_FIELDS` environment value.

<!-- TODO link to the page on schema -->

Here is an example on the way to proceed to add a `nickname` value to the registration:

1. Add a column `nickname` of type text to the `public.users` table
2. Set the environment variable `REGISTRATION_CUSTOM_FIELDS=nickname`
3. The registration endpoint now expects a `nickname` value in addition to `email` and `password`

::: warning
Any given field must exist in the `users` GraphQL type that corresponds to the `public.users` PostgreSQL table, or registration will fail.
