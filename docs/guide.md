# Getting started

## Installation

### Nhost

The easiest way to deploy HBP is with the official [Nhost](https://nhost.io) managed service. Get your perfect configured backend with PostgreSQL, Hasura and Hasura Backend Plus and save yourself hours of maintenance per month.

All [Nhost](https://nhost.io) projects are built on open source software so you can make realtime web and mobile apps fast ðŸš€.

  </a>
</div>

### Docker-compose

Create the following `docker-compose.yaml` file, and modify the Hasura Admin Secret in both `graphql-engine` and `hasura-backend-plus` services.

<<< @/examples/simple-hasura-minio/docker-compose.yaml

Then start the services:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

Everything is now up and running.

If you want to get a more advanced example in using an S3-compatible Object Storage, see the [Minio example](recipes#minio) in the recipes.
