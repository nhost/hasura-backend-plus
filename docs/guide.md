# Getting started

## Installation

### Nhost

The easiest way to deploy HBP is with the official [Nhost](https://nhost.io) managed service. Get your perfect configured backend with PostgreSQL, Hasura and Hasura Backend Plus and save yourself hours of maintenance per month.

All [Nhost](https://nhost.io) projects are built on open source software so you can make realtime web and mobile apps fast ðŸš€.

  </a>
</div>

### Docker-Compose

Create the following `docker-compose.yaml` file, and modify the Hasura Admin Secret in both `graphql-engine` and `hasura-backend-plus` services.

<<< @/examples/simple-hasura-minio/docker-compose.yaml

Then start the services:

```shell
export HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET=<your Hasura Admin secret>
docker-compose up -d
```

Everything should be up and running. HBP is listening to `http://localhost:3000` and Hasura Graphql Engine is listening to `http://localhost:8080`.

You can then run the Hasura Console in following the [official instructions](https://hasura.io/docs/1.0/graphql/manual/hasura-cli/hasura_console.html).

If you want to get a more advanced example in using an S3-compatible Object Storage, see the [Minio example](recipes#minio) in the recipes.

### Standalone

You can also install HBP without any other service, and connect it to an existing Hasura server, and/or an S3 instance if you plan to use the storage features.
The easiest way is to pull and run a Docker container, but you can also run the service from the source code.

#### Using Docker

```sh
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
  -e "HASURA_ENDPOINT=<your Hasura graphql endpoint>" \
  -e "HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET=<your Hasura admin secret>" \
  -e "JWT_KEY=<your JWT RSA256 key>" \
  nhost/hasura-backend-plus:latest
```

<!-- TODO You can also pass on the configuration to connect to an S3 service  -->

#### From the source code

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nhost/hasura-backend-plus.git
cd hasura-backend-plus
yarn
cp .env.example .env
yarn start
```

## Registration

By default, anyone can register with an email address and a password:

```shell
curl -d '{"email":"real@emailadress.com", "password":"StrongPasswordNot1234"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/register`
```

You can however add some safeguards and limitations to the registration process like email verification, constraints on emails and passwords, or setting additional registration fields from your custom database schema. More information is available in the [registration configuration chapter](configuration.md#registration).
