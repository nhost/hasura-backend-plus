## Pwned Passwords

Authway comes with an opt-in feature to check passwords against the [HIBP](https://haveibeenpwned.com) API. These checks are only performed during registration and password recovery. The password is given in plain text, [but only the first 5 characters of its SHA-1 hash will be submitted to the API](https://github.com/wKovacs64/hibp/blob/develop/API.md#pwnedpassword). Enable the feature by setting `HIBP_ENABLED` to true in your `.env` file.
