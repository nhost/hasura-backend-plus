## Install

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your machine.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/nhost/hasura-backend-plus.git
$ cd hasura-backend-plus && git checkout v2
```

Install the required dependencies.

```sh
$ npm install
```

## Usage

Start your Hasura instance with the following [environment variables](https://hasura.io/docs/1.0/graphql/manual/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/config-examples.html) set:

```sh
HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET: a_very_secure_admin_secret_goes_here
HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET: '{"type": "HS256", "key": "a_very_secure_jwt_secret_goes_here"}'
```

Install the Hasura CLI to run migrations:

```sh
$ npm i -g hasura-cli
$ hasura init hasura --endpoint "<endpoint>" --admin-secret "<admin-secret>"
$ mv hasura/config.yaml . && rm -rf hasura && hasura migrate apply
```

Make sure to add `user` to the `public.roles` table through the Hasura Console.

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```sh
$ cp .env.example .env && $EDITOR $_
```

Edit the file and start the server üöÄ

```sh
$ npm i -g pm2
$ pm2 start npm --name "hbp" -- start
```

## Update

You can apply the latest updates by running:

```sh
$ git pull origin
$ npm install
$ pm2 restart hbp
```

To confirm that everything's working properly, run:

```sh
$ pm2 logs hbp
```

## Pwned Passwords

HBP v2 comes with an opt-in feature to check passwords against the [HIBP](https://haveibeenpwned.com) API. These checks are only performed during registration and password recovery. The password is given in plain text, [but only the first 5 characters of its SHA-1 hash will be submitted to the API](https://github.com/wKovacs64/hibp/blob/develop/API.md#pwnedpassword). Enable the feature by setting `HIBP_ENABLED` to true in your `.env` file.

## Signed Cookies

HBP v2 comes with an opt-in feature to sign cookies. You can enable it by setting `COOKIE_SECRET` to something strong and secure in your `.env` file. Be careful, though ‚Äî existing unsigned refresh tokens will stop working.
